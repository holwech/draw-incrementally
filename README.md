# A brief example

![Usage example of incrementally](public/svg_record.gif?raw=true "A brief example of incrementally in use")
Svg offers an interesting set of capabilities compared to other file types â€” recording of an svg even more so.

This recording functionality comes from the [drawify](https://github.com/holwech/drawify) repository.

### Developing

This example uses the `drawify` package. For developing the `drawify` package locally, a library called `npm-link-copy` is used to automatically update the package.

Run `npm install -g laggingreflex/npm-link-copy` to install, got to the project folder (`some/path/to/draw-frontend`) and run `npm-link-copy ../some/path/to/draw -w`.
